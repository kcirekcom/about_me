          <li><h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a freelance graphic designer working primarily in logo development. I'm also an amateur writer dabbling in fictional narratives of mystery and science fiction. I constantly pursue different interests as a way of becoming a more versatile person. Above all else, I'm career-focused and a man of action. I finish what I start, and I won't walk away from a project until I feel that it is the best representation of my work ethic and creative ability.</p>
          </li>

          <li><h2>Career Objective</h2>
            <p>Data visualization is the discipline that I've been trying to develop my expertise and skills in lately. My goal is to establish a platform to visually communicate information and data that will resonate with a variety of audiences.</p>
          </li>

          <li><h2>Education Summary</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Azusa Pacific University in May 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and 3.42 GPA. I was originally drawn to the discipline of Psychology due to the practice of quantitative and qualitative research of social trends. Since then, I have been cultivating my reasearch skills through mutliple projects that include the layout of information and data. I'm currently attending courses in software development at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA.</p>
