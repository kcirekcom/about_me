          <li><h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="erick_pic.jpg" alt="Erick" width="200" height="200">
            <p>I'm a freelance graphic designer working primarily in logo development. I'm also an amateur writer dabbling in fictional narratives of mystery and science fiction. I constantly pursue different interests as a way of becoming a more versatile person. Above all else, I'm career-focused and a man of action. I finish what I start, and I won't walk away from a project until I feel that it is the best representation of my work ethic and creative ability.</p>

          <li><h2>Career Objective</h2>

            <p>I graduated from Azusa Pacific University in May 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and 3.42 GPA. I was originally drawn to the discipline of Psychology due to the practice of quantitative and qualitative research of social trends. Since then, I have been cultivating my reasearch skills through mutliple projects that include the layout of information and data.</p>
