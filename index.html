  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <article>
    <img src="erick_pic.jpg" alt="Erick" width="90" height="90">
    <p>I graduated from Azusa Pacific University in May 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and 3.42 GPA. I was originally drawn to the discipline of Psychology due to the practice of quantitative and qualitative research of social trends. Since then, I have been cultivating my reasearch skills through mutliple projects that include the layout of information and data. Hence, I like to represent myself as a creative visionary of information and data. Aside from that tagline, I'm a freelance graphic designer working primarily in logo development. I'm also an amateur writer dabbling in fictional narratives of mystery and science fiction. I constantly pursue different interests as a way of becoming a more versatile person. Above all else, I'm career-focused and a man of action. I finish what I start, and I won't walk away from a project until I feel that it is the best representation of my work ethic and creative ability.</p>

    <p>Data visualization is the discipline that I've been trying to develop my expertise and skills in lately. My career focus is to establish a platform to visually communicate information and data that will resonate with greater audiences.</p>
